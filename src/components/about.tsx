          The mission of our team is to translate the p5.js website from English to Japanese and provide j5.js resources in Japanese through Japansese version of p5.js website.
          A reason why we have tackled to translate p5.js website and contribute to j5.js community from 2017, we had learned so much through Processing.
          I have been working on the translation with students from Meisei University since September 2021.
          It is referenced by organizations that operate and develop p5.js as an example of how to make it multilingual.
